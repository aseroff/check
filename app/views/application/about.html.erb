<h1>About</h1>

<p>The goal of Gamekeeper is singular: make it easy to track and share the board games you play.</p>

<h2>Team</h2>

<p>@aseroff is a web application developer and check-in app veteran. After spending 5 years in the social TV space following the streaming revolution and the quality TV renaissance, he noticed a similar rise in the profile of board games. Considering the lack of a casually accessible check-in app for board games, he developed Gamekeeper over two months in 2017.</p>

<p>At the moment, Gamekeeper has no revenue to offset its costs, which means it will run off your generous donations to the  addresses found here.</p>
